Word Count
Create a website that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able to input both the word and the string of words to check. You’ll need to account for case sensitivity (“HI” isn’t the same as “hi”) and punctuation (“hi” isn’t the same as “hi!”). Make sure to commit your code after each passing spec and write a spec each time you add functionality.
